Final project from Coursera course: Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars.

I implemented drivable space estimation in 3D, lane estimation, clustering, error filtering of 2D object detectors with the help of the output of semantic segmentation neural networks. The filtered 2D object detection results were used to determine how far obstacles are from the car.
